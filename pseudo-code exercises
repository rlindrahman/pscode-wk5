// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num1 ends in 2, 4, 6, 8, or 0= even
num1 ends in 1,3, 5, 7, 9= odd
For any number, if it can be divided by two withouut any remainders, then this is an even number. If it cannot be evenly divided by two without remainders, it is an odd number. 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a. List 5 numbers 
num1, num2, num3, num4, num5

b. START 
//Initialize a list of 5 numbers
DECLARE list [5]
//Variable to store the sum of the numbers
SET sum TO 0
//Prompt the useer to input the 5 numbers
FOR i FROM 0 to 4 DO
PRINT "Enter number", i+1
INPUT lists [i]
//ADd the number to the sum
SET sum TO sum = list[i]
END FOR
//Calculate the average
SET average TO sum / 5
//Output the average
PRINT "The average is", average
END

c. Initialize a list of 5 numbers
num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
For i from 0 to 4
Print "Enter number," i+1
Input list [i]

//Assume the first number is bothe the lowest and highest 
Set lowest TO list [0]
Set highest TO list [0]

//Iterate through the list to find the actual lowest and highest numbers
For i from 1 to 4 DO
If list [i] <lowest -THEN
set lowest to list[i
END IF
If list{i} >highest
THEN SET hightest TO list[i]
END IF
END For
//Output the lowest and highest numbers 
PRINT "The lowest number is," lowest
PRINT "The highest number is," highest
END
